The goal is to help students understand long-term trends, cyclical patterns, and potential impacts of economic events on the housing market. Students will focus on creating insightful time series visualizations to explore key metrics such as home prices, sales volume, mortgage rates, and housing inventory. Obtain housing market time series data from reliable sources. Select at least three different time series metrics to analyze. You can choose from the following:
Median home prices (nationally or regionally).
Housing sales volume (number of units sold).
Mortgage interest rates.
Housing inventory or vacancy rates.
New construction starts or permits issued.
Time Period: Focus on analyzing data over a minimum of 10 years to identify long-term trends. You may also include more specific time periods such as the 2008 housing crisis, the post-pandemic housing boom, or recent fluctuations in mortgage rates.
